          <p>MARYLAND - The percentage of women receiving early prenatal care in Maryland increased from 82 percent in 2011 to 83 percent in 2013, despite the fact that the Affordable Care Act requires all insurance plans to cover maternal and newborn care-which includes early prenatal care-state data shows.</p>
          <p>This is a negligible increase.</p>
          <p>A Maryland Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System survey reported the following statistics for 2013:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>20.5 percent of women were uninsured before becoming pregnant.</li>
              <li>5.7 percent of women were uninsured during pregnancy.</li>
              <li>16 percent of women were uninsured postpartum.</li>
            </ul>
          <p>This means a majority of uninsured women were getting health care for all or part of their pregnancy and then going back to being uninsured after their pregnancy.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Women who qualify for Medicaid because of their pregnancy “can retain coverage for about two months postpartum,” Brittany Fowler, deputy director of communications for the Maryland Department of Health, said.</p>
        <p>Private and marketplace insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act also only provide postpartum care for eight weeks, according to the Maryland Department of Health.</p>
        <p>“This allows the mother to get her two postpartum appointments,” Jelacic said.</p>
        <p>The first postpartum appointment is to discuss the delivery, birth control, breastfeeding and to check for infection, Jelacic said.</p>
        <p>“The second appointment is to medically clear the patient to return to work or school to be sure they have fully healed and to administer birth control if the patient desires it,” Jelacic said.</p>
        <p>But the Affordable Care Act’s required maternal and newborn health care coverage, if women were able to get it, ends after these two months, the Maryland Department of Health reported.</p>

        <p>The minimal uptick in the percentage of women getting early prenatal care since the Affordable Care Act was passed is compounded by the fact that access to early prenatal care is not equal between races, the March of Dimes Perinatal Data Center reported.</p>
        <p>The March of Dimes Perinatal Data Center published the following statistics for Maryland in 2014:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>79 percent of live-birth white infants received early prenatal care.</li>
            <li>60.3 percent of live-birth black babies received early prenatal care.</li>
            <li>52.3 percent of live-birth Hispanic babies received early prenatal care.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>This means a black infant was 24 percent less likely and a Hispanic infant was 39 percent less likely than a white infant to have received early prenatal care.</p>
        <p>“Many pregnant women do not get the care they need when they need it,” Michele Kling, a March of Dimes spokesperson said. “[This can be the case for] women of all races and ethnicities and from all walks of life.” </p>
        <p>Because of socioeconomic factors, some women are less likely to get the care they need, particularly black and Hispanic women, Kling said.</p>

        <p>Maryland expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and this expansion “was funded almost entirely by the federal government,” Michel Boudreaux, assistant professor of health services administration at the University of Maryland School of Public Health, said.</p>
        <p>Pregnant women can only qualify for Medicaid if they make under a certain income, Laurie Jelacic, assistant director for the Pregnancy Aid Center, a non-profit women’s health clinic, said.</p>
        <p>“To help more women have coverage during pregnancy, income requirements for Medicaid are much higher for pregnant women then for women who are not pregnant,” Jelacic said.</p>
        <p>But organizations such as the Pregnancy Aid Center are still needed for some pregnant women to get early prenatal care.</p>
        <p>“What sets us apart from other OB/GYNs or clinics in the area is we will see patients if their Medicaid is pending or before it [their Medicaid card] says eligible’,” Jelacic said.</p>
        <p>An application for Medicaid can take several weeks to process, “which can impede getting into care,” Jelacic said.</p>
        <p>“However, the health outcomes of mothers and infants is very complex and involves many factors other than health insurance,” Boudreaux said.</p>
        <p>The Maryland Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System surveyed 4,548 Maryland mothers who gave birth between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2011 about the factors that contributed to them getting late or no prenatal care.</p>
        <p>No insurance ranked eighth on the list-behind such factors as no transportation, no leave and not knowing they were pregnant.</p>
