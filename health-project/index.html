          <p>College Park, Md.-Two yellow houses off Baltimore Avenue offer hope to uninsured pregnant women. These houses are owned and operated by Pregnancy Aid Centers, Inc. (PAC), a non-profit women's health clinic. Maternal and newborn care, which includes early prenatal care, is considered an essential health benefit under the Affordable Care Act. This means pregant women can enroll in or change their health coverage at any time without penalties. But the percentage of women receiving early prenatal care has only increased one percent between 2011 (82 percent) and 2013 (83 percent). Organizations such as PAC are still needed for some pregnant women to get early prenatal care.</p>

          <p>The Maryland Pregnancy Risk Assessment onitoring System (PRAMS) conducted a survey in 2013 of 1,239 women. The study found that 20.5 percent of these women were uninsured before pregnancy. A majority of the surveyed women got insurance during their pregnancy and then went back to being uninsured postpartum. This chart shows the percentage range (accounting for the statistical margin of error) of women's insurance status before, during and after pregnancy.</p>

          <p>The Maryland Department of Health defines early prenatal care as receiving care within the first trimester of pregnancy and reports that women who begin prenatal care in the first three months are less likely to have pregnancy complications and more likely to have healthy babies. But access to this vital health care service is not equal between white, black and hispanic infants. From 2012-2014, a black infant was 24 percent less likely and a hispanic infant was 39 percent less likely than a white infant to have received early prenatal care.</p>

          <p>Pregnant women who receive late (third trimester) or no prenatal care are three times more likely to give birth to a low birthweight baby, according to the March of Dimes Perinatal Data Center. The CDC uses the term low birthweight to describe babies who are born weighing less than 2500 grams, or 5 pounds 8 ounces. This chart compares the percentage of low birthweight births to the percentage of women who received late or no prenatal care in each Maryland county.</p>
